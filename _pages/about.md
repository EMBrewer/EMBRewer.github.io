## Bio
Hello, I am a Research Assistant Professor within the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at NYU and a member of the Visualization and Data Analytics Research Center at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering under <a href='https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/claudio-silva'>Claudio Silva</a>. My research interests are centered around utilizing geospatial data and computer vision to inform policy and decision making in the contexts of international development and urban design. I hold a Ph.D. in geospatial data science from William & Mary (under <a href='https://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/people/runfola_d.php'>Dan Runfola</a>). I also hold an M.S. in applied physics from William & Mary and a B.S. in physics from UMBC.

## Research Goals  
(1) reveal patterns in development, population, and the environment in data-sparse and data-adverse conditions,

(2) fill in critical information gaps to better understand social and economic outcomes and events in these areas,

(3) develop interdisciplinary collaborations and computational and empirical methods to achieve these aims, and

(4) impart this knowledge to the next generation of leaders.

## Current Research
Please see my Google Scholar or CV for an up-to-date list of publications.
