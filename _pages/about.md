## Bio
I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at NYU and a member of the Visualization and Data Analytics (VIDA) Research Center under <a href='https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/claudio-silva'>Claudio Silva</a>. My research interests are primarliy centered around the utilization of geospatial data and computer vision to inform policy and decision making in the contexts of international development and urban science. I hold a Ph.D. in geospatial data science from William & Mary (under <a href='https://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/people/runfola_d.php'>Dan Runfola</a>). I also hold an M.S. in applied physics from William & Mary and a B.S. in physics from UMBC.

## Research Goals  
(1) Understand patterns in development, population, and the environment in data-sparse conditions;

(2) Fill in critical information gaps to better understand social and economic outcomes in these areas;

(3) Develop interdisciplinary collaborations and computational and empirical methods to achieve these aims;

(4) Impart this knowledge to the next generation of leaders.

## Research Record
Please see my CV or Google Scholar for an up-to-date list of publications.
