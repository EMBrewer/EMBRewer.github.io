Hello, I'm Ethan Brewer. I'm a Research Assistant Professor at NYU. My research interests are prodly centered around harnessing geographic and geospatial data and computer vision to inform policy and decision making in the context of international development and urban design.

My core goals are to (1) reveal patterns in development, population, and the environment in data-sparse and data-adverse conditions, (2) fill in critical information gaps to better understand social and economic outcomes and events in these areas, (3) develop interdisciplinary collaborations and computational and empirical methods to achieve these aims, and (4) impart this knowledge to the next generation of leaders.

Please see my Google Scholar or CV for a full list of publications.

I hold a Ph.D. in geospatial data science from William & Mary. I also hold an M.S. in applied physics from William & Mary and a B.S. in physics from UMBC.
